%I am a motivated Ph.D. Candidate in Plant Breeding with a Statistics minor at Iowa State University. My field of expertise and research interest include quantitative and statistical genetics, biometry, and biostatistics. I have extensive experience in \texttt{R} programming and contributed to many collaborative projects focused on data analysis. In addition, during my academic career, I had hands-on experience in daily breeding operations in different countries. My expected graduation date is the Spring of 2023.
